# What it Does
This application demonstrates how to create a working smart video solution to detect human poses while generating a motion heatmap. The implementation can be used to analyze traffic patterns on factory floors and if workers are performing correct procedures. It can also be used to analyze retail/store shelves to see if people are grabbing certain products more than others. Users can also perform sports analysis on players poses and frequency of movement on areas in a court or field.
