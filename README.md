# What it Does
This application demonstrates how to create a working smart video solution to detect human poses while generating a motion heatmap. The implementation can be used as a foundation to analyze traffic patterns on factory floors and if workers are performing correct procedures. It can also be used to analyze retail/store shelves to see if people are grabbing certain products more than others. Users can also perform sports analysis on players poses and frequency of movement on areas in a court or field. 

# How it Works
The application detects a human skeleton and pixel changes in a video input or camera stream to generate the heatmap for each frame. The heatmap is generated by OpenCV 4.0+ functions: background subtraction, application of a threshold, accumlation of changed pixels over time and then adding a color/heat map. 
The pose detection uses a two-branch multistage CNN using OpenPose architecture to detect 18 keypoints: ears, eyes, nose, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees and ankles. The first branch predicts confidence maps S n and The second branch predicts Part Affinity Fields L n. The two map predictions are parsed with the input image features and will product the keypoints.

[And the network architecture information] (https://www.learnopencv.com/deep-learning-based-human-pose-estimation-using-opencv-cpp-python/) 
The pose detector and heatmap generator are merged together
